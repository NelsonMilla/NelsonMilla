👋 Hello! I'm Nelson, a passionate full stack developer with expertise in Python Django, React, and Angular. 🚀

💻 I enjoy building robust and scalable web applications that deliver seamless user experiences. With years of hands-on experience in both backend and frontend development, I thrive on solving complex problems and bringing ideas to life.

🌐 On the backend, I excel in Python and the Django framework. I have a deep understanding of RESTful APIs, database management, and server-side development. I prioritize code quality, maintainability, and security in all my projects.

🎨 When it comes to the frontend, I'm well-versed in creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces using React and Angular. I have a strong command of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I leverage modern tools and libraries to build responsive and visually appealing applications.

🔧 I believe in the power of collaboration and continuously seek to improve my skills. I'm always exploring new technologies and staying up-to-date with industry trends. I'm also comfortable working in an Agile development environment and thrive in teams that foster innovation and growth.

Happy coding! 😄
