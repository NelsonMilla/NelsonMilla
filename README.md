👋 Hello! I’m Nelson, a full stack developer, startup founder, and tech lead with deep expertise in Python Django, React, Next.js, and Angular.

🚀 Over the years, I’ve architected and launched scalable web applications for startups, fintech, and biotech ventures—delivering seamless, high-impact user experiences. My work spans backend, frontend, and cloud infrastructure, from building robust RESTful APIs and secure databases to crafting pixel-perfect UIs and leading end-to-end product development.

🌐 On the backend, I specialize in Python and Django, designing resilient, maintainable architectures and integrating complex data flows. I’m well-versed in database management, API design, authentication, and security best practices. Recently, I’ve also led projects leveraging blockchain (Solana, smart contracts) and cloud platforms like Firebase.

🎨 For the frontend, I bring ideas to life using React, Angular, and Next.js—creating dynamic, responsive applications with modern UI/UX patterns. I excel at building user-friendly interfaces that drive engagement, using the latest in JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS.

🧑‍💻 As a founder and CTO, I thrive in fast-paced startup environments—managing cross-functional teams, iterating on products, and navigating technical, operational, and legal challenges. I enjoy mentoring developers, setting up Agile workflows, and driving innovation from 0 to 1.

🌱 I’m always exploring new technologies and frameworks, from AI to decentralized governance, and I have a strong interest in jurisdiction-as-a-service, smart cities, and next-generation fintech/biotech. I believe in open collaboration, lifelong learning, and building software that makes a difference.

Let’s connect and create something amazing together!

Happy coding! 😄
